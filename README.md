# Disney Trivia 

A fun mini project that merges my love of Disney and practising my React and Express Skills. This was an interesting project to work on as most of my other ones have been more functional, helpful tools rather than just for fun! 
I had my first experience with React Toastify and storing image files in my database. 
Clone this repo and have a go:)
